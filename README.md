# cvsbench
I wrote some Nelua code to ingest a 20MB .csv file, ran it, and found it to
be alarmingly slow compared to a reference implementation in Nim. This
repository has that original code, the Nim reference implementation, and some
improvements, and a report of time and space usage.

The 20MB .csv file is included and is an old download of openrussian.org's
sentence table.

some conclusions:
- I was doing a lot of batch work during ingestion that could be delayed to
  later I/O when it would be cheap. I was already annoyed by how long it was
  taking with the reference implementation.
- I was decoding UTF8 in order to match ASCII bytes, which is unnecessary as
  ASCII bytes can't occur in multibyte UTF8 sequences: a tab is always a tab.
- mmap works as well as expected
